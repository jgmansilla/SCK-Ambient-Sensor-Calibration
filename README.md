# SCK-Ambient-Sensor-Calibration-NEW
Smart Citizen Kit Ambient Sensor Calibration


The main purpose of this version of the SCKAmbient.cpp (Smart Citizen Kit beta_v0_9 firmware) is to add these new features to the code:

· Convert the sensor resistance values into CO concentration values in parts per million or ppm based on the manufacturer's specifications.

· Convert the sensor resistance values into NO2 concentration values in parts per billion or ppb based on the manufacturer's specifications.

· Correct temperature dependence of the CO Sensor
